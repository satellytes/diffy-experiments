Some stuff that is useful to check from time to time.

## Gitlab
In [gitlab](/gitlab) you'll find some copied over sources for reference.
Clone and check the actual gitlab repo for details and the complete sources. It's a good source because they have the [merge request diff viewer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/) written in Vue.

I picked notes and diffs first as those reflect the code for the actual diffs and notes are all about discussion/comments.

The diff parser seems to be written in Ruby so they can use the parsed results for search and additional annotations per line (discussable?, suggestible?, rich_text etc)
