# Experiment 2: Vue Diffy

It's a pain in the ass to start projects these days and if you are not experienced you need to be lucky
to know the CLI (if any) or decide for webpack, parcel, snowpack etc. Mostly gone are the days that you can create an `index.html`
and start creating some code (even though there are projects who want to achieve this: deno, pika)

Anyway here is what I know about vue and this works pretty good:

```
npx @vue/cli create --default vue-diffy

cd vue-diffy
yarn add @vue/cli
yarn vue add typescript
yarn serve
```
